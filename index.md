## The Problem

Since the advent of digital devices in general, and smartphones in particualr, more and more of our daily lives are spent looking at a screens. The promise of digital devices &mdash; that they will make us more productive and free us from the drudgery of menial tasks &mdash; has been delivered on quite spectacularly in many ways. We now enjoy quick access to applications that handle day-to-day tasks such as banking; that can get us directions to where we're going, and even find us a ride; and that integrate a dizzying number of entertainment options to keep us occupied in our downtime. An emerging trend is the so called "super-app" that not only collects these applications on a single device, but also under a single app on that device.

More and more then, we are tied to our devices, dependent on them to provide us services that were once rendered by individual, brick and mortar institutions. In doing so we've sacrificed some of our freedom from technology, and have also developed potentially harmful habits. A Harvard Medical School study found that excessive screentime had adverse effects on everything from sleep to creativity [[1]](https://hms.harvard.edu/news/screen-time-brain). The admonishments against spending too much time on our phones and other devices is particularly salient now more than ever with the COVID-19 pandemic forcing many of us to work from home, interacting with others from behind a flickering, blue-light-emitting barrier.
  
With this in mind our design firm has been hired by OptiScreen Inc. to develop a super-app that promotes healthy screen habits and lifestyle choces.

## Research

### Existing Apps

There are of course already many apps that attempt to promote healthy habits such as fitness trackers and apps that promote wellbeing by encouraging users to practice self care and healthy eating habits. For example, iFit is an app intented to help users design a workout routine and track their progess against it. It can integrate with certain workout equipemnt to facilitate tracking, thus streamlining the user experience [[2]](https://www.ifit.com/). Another example, ShopWell, aims to help users acheive their dietary goals by tracking the food they eat, and recommending items to purchase at the groecery store that aligns with their health needs [[3]](http://www.shopwell.com/nutrition).

The common theme threading through these examples, and the many other health-oriented apps on the market is their targeted precision. They attempt to enhance users lives by promoting a small, specific set of activities. This approach seems natural &mdash; they do one thing and they do it well. However, we hypothesize that a more holistic approach whereby the features provided to users by individual apps are integrated into a single application could achieve more by providing a more coherent user experience. In the following section we discuss our research on this premise.

### Public Survey
In order to better understand potential users of (the app), we conducted a public survey of 25 people. The survey responses are summarized and analyzed below.

Of the 25 people surveyed, only 11 conciously tracked their amount of screentime on a regular basis. Additionally, in the past 6 months only 8% of people surveyed stated that their average screentime decreased, while 60% stated that their screentime increased. With the increased dependency on technology as a means of human connection with escalating restrictions due to COVID-19, it is becoming more and more important to manage screentime effectively for both physical and mental health.

Excessive screentime (especially in the hour before bedtime) is known to casue a decrease in natuaral melatonin levels, resulting in poor sleep quality and difficulty falling asleep [[4]](https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/evening-screen-time-can-sabotage-sleep). This is supported by our survey data, as of those who reported having difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, 57% of them stated that they stopped looking at screens less than 10 minutes before bed.

As for app usage, each of the following categories had over 70% of surveyed users say that they used their digital devices for them: Reading/sending emails, social networking, text messaging, browsing the internet, watching movies/tv, playing games, and watching videos. Of those categories, the three that reportedly occupied the most time were social networking, watching videos, and playing games. The survey also prompted responders to identify which types of "healthy lifestyle apps" they use currently or in the past on a daily basis. The results from this question are detailed in the image below.

Finally, respondents were asked to what extent they agree with the following statements. To the statement "I feel as if my digital devices, and the activities I engage in on them, are a distraction", 56% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed. Next, to the statement "I find the time I spend interacting with my digital devices to be enjoyable", 76% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed. And lastly, to the statement "I am worried that the amount of time I spend interacting with my digital devices is adversely affecting my physical and/or mental health", 56% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed. From these responses, it can be interpreted that despite the time spent interacting with digital being enjoyable, they ultimately become distracting, and most people are at least somewhat concerned about how this time is affecting their mental and physical well being.

### Expert Interview
Another way that our team gathered information on the subject of mental and physical wellness, was by consulting an expert in the field. The individual that we had the pleasure of speaking with holds the following degrees and certifications.
- Bachelor of Physical and Health Education (BPHE)
- Bachelor of Arts (BA)
- Professional Certified Coach (PCC) with the International Coaching Federation (ICF)
- Certificate in coaching with positive psychology
- Certificate in coaching with emotional intelligence

Our expert was asked to reflect on their years of education and experience, to answer a handful of questions. The first thing we learned from speaking with an expert is that an increased amount of screentime in a person's daily routine is generally known to worsen their mental wellbeing. Their opinion on how much screen time is appropriate for the average person is 1/3rd of their waking hours, which for most people is approximately 5 hours. Reflecting on our public survey results, the majority of people spend 10+ hours per day looking at some form of screen. Evidently, the implication of these results is that most people average more than double our expert's recommended time.

As a countermeasure to rising amounts of screentime, our experts suggested the following strategies. First, having non-screen activities on hand and schedule them intermittently throughout the day to break up screen time. These activies could include listening to music, exercising, reading etc. Next, our expert recommended using only one primary source of social media, in an effort to reduce the amount of time spent scrolling. Lastly, in light of the pandemic, our expert advised using screens for genuine human connection as much as possible. Meaning, trading scrolling through media feeds for video calling with friends as this is known to replenish one's emotional tank.

## User Personas
Base on our research, we have developed the following personas that capture the behavioral variables of our targeted user bases.

## Journey map / Empathy Map
We created the following empathy and journey maps for the Fiona persona.

## Sketches / Wireframes
We began with a simple sketch for our homepage.

## Design
### Colors
The color palettes we chose are meant to be easy on the eye, and reduce the strain caused by extended screen use. To that end, we use pale colors and avoid high contrast.

### Typography
We felt that using a serif font would come off as too serious, while a sasn-serif font would be too boring. We decided to compromise with a rounded-serif font, which is vivid and stimulating. It's also a little playful, which we feel will help put our users at ease. Ultimately, we went with Neuton.

## Conclusion
We found the design process both illuminating and rewarding. By conducting research on the problem and users' behavioral patterns first, we were more confident that our design decisions later on were relevant to them, and enhanced rather than hindered their needs and goals. We enjoyed incrementally and iteratively refining our conception of our users and the user experience we plan to deliver to them. Given the opportunity, we would like to develop this application further.
