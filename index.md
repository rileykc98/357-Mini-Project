## The Problem

Since the advent of digital devices in general, and smartphones in particualr, more and more of our daily lives are spent looking at a screens. The promise of digital devices &mdash; that they will make us more productive and free us from the drudgery of menial tasks &mdash; has been delivered on quite spectacularly in many ways. We now enjoy quick access to applications that handle day-to-day tasks such as banking; that can get us directions to where we're going, and even find us a ride; and that integrate a dizzying number of entertainment options to keep us occupied in our downtime. An emerging trend is the so called "super-app" that not only collects these applications on a single device, but also under a single app on that device.

More and more then, we are tied to our devices, dependent on them to provide us services that were once rendered by individual, brick and mortar institutions. In doing so we've sacrificed some of our freedom from technology, and have also developed potentially harmful habits. A Harvard Medical School study found that excessive screentime had adverse effects on everything from sleep to creativity <TODO citation>. The admonishments against spending too much time on our phones and other devices is particularly salient now more than ever with the COVID-19 pandemic forcing many of us to work from home, interacting with others from behind a flickering, blue-light-emitting barrier.
  
With this in mind our design firm has been hired by OptiScreen Inc. to develop a super-app that promotes healthy screen habits and lifestyle choces.

## Research

### Existing Apps

There are of course already many apps that attempt to promote healthy habits such as fitness trackers and apps that promote wellbeing by encouraging users to practice self care and healthy eating habits. For example, iFit is an app intented to help users design a workout routine and track their progess against it. It can integrate with certain workout equipemnt to facilitate tracking, thus streamlining the user experience <TODO citation>. Another example, ShopWell, aims to help users acheive their dietary goals by tracking the food they eat, and recommending items to purchase at the groecery store that aligns with their health needs <TODO citation>.

The common theme threading through these examples, and the many other health-oriented apps on the market is their targeted precision. They attempt to enhance users lives by promoting a small, specific set of activities. This approach seems natural &mdash; they do one thing and they do it well. However, we hypothesize that a more holistic approach whereby the features provided to users by individual apps are integrated into a single application could achieve more by providing a more coherent user experience. In the following section we discuss our research on this premise.

### Public Survey
In order to better understand potential users of (the app), we conducted a public survey of 25 people. The survey responses are summarized and analyzed below.

Of the 25 people surveyed, only 11 conciously tracked their amount of screentime on a regular basis. Additionally, in the past 6 months only 8% of people surveyed stated that their average screentime decreased, while 60% stated that their screentime increased. With the increased dependency on technology as a means of human connection with escalating restrictions due to COVID-19, it is becoming more and more important to manage screentime effectively for both physical and mental health.

Excessive screentime (especially in the hour before bedtime) is known to casue a decrease in natuaral melatonin levels, resulting in poor sleep quality and difficulty falling asleep [[1]](https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/evening-screen-time-can-sabotage-sleep). This is supported by our survey data, as of those who reported having difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, 57% of them stated that they stopped looking at screens less than 10 minutes before bed.

As for app usage, each of the following categories had over 70% of surveyed users say that they used their digital devices for them: Reading/sending emails, social networking, text messaging, browsing the internet, watching movies/tv, playing games, and watching videos. Of those categories, the three that reportedly occupied the most time were social networking, watching videos, and playing games. The survey also prompted responders to identify which types of "healthy lifestyle apps" they use currently or in the past on a daily basis. The results from this question are detailed in the image below.

Finally, respondents were asked to what extent they agree with the following statements. To the statement "I feel as if my digital devices, and the activities I engage in on them, are a distraction", 56% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed. Next, to the statement "I find the time I spend interacting with my digital devices to be enjoyable", 76% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed. And lastly, to the statement "I am worried that the amount of time I spend interacting with my digital devices is adversely affecting my physical and/or mental health", 56% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed. From these responses, it can be interpreted that despite the time spent interacting with digital being enjoyable, they ultimately become distracting, and most people are at least somewhat concerned about how this time is affecting their mental and physical well being.

## User Personas
Base on our research, we have developed the following user personas that capture the behavioral variables of our targeted users bases.

## Journey map / Empathy Map
The following empathy map and journey map were created from the point of view of a generic user that shares the common traits of the personas above, but may lack the idiosyncracies of any particular persona.

## Sketches / Wireframes

## Design + Color palette
The color palettes we chose are meant to be easy on the eye, and reduce the strain caused by extended screen use. To that end, we use pale colors and avoid high contrast.

We felt that using a serif font would come off as too serious, while a sasn-serif font would be too boring. We decided to compromise with a rounded-serif font, which is vivid and stimulating, and also a little playful. Ultimately, we went with Neuton.
