### Public Survey
In order to better understand potential users of (the app), we conducted a public survey of 25 people. The survey responses are summarized and analyzed below.

Of the 25 people surveyed, only 11 conciously tracked their amount of screentime on a regular basis. Additionally, in the past 6 months only 8% of people surveyed stated that their average screentime decreased, while 60% stated that their screentime increased. With the increased dependency on technology as a means of human connection with escalating restrictions due to COVID-19, it is becoming more and more important to manage screentime effectively for both physical and mental health.

Excessive screentime (especially in the hour before bedtime) is known to casue a decrease in natuaral melatonin levels, resulting in poor sleep quality and difficulty falling asleep [[1]](https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/evening-screen-time-can-sabotage-sleep). This is supported by our survey data, as of those who reported having difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, 57% of them stated that they stopped looking at screens less than 10 minutes before bed.

As for app usage, each of the following categories had over 70% of surveyed users say that they used their digital devices for them: Reading/sending emails, social networking, text messaging, browsing the internet, watching movies/tv, playing games, and watching videos. Of those categories, the three that reportedly occupied the most time were social networking, watching videos, and playing games. The survey also prompted responders to identify which types of "healthy lifestyle apps" they use currently or in the past on a daily basis. The results from this question are detailed in the image below.

Finally, respondents were asked to what extent they agree with the following statements. To the statement "I feel as if my digital devices, and the activities I engage in on them, are a distraction", 56% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed. Next, to the statement "I find the time I spend interacting with my digital devices to be enjoyable", 76% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed. And lastly, to the statement "I am worried that the amount of time I spend interacting with my digital devices is adversely affecting my physical and/or mental health", 56% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed. From these responses, it can be interpreted that despite the time spent interacting with digital being enjoyable, they ultimately become distracting, and most people are at least somewhat concerned about how this time is affecting their mental and physical well being.

### Expert Interview
Another way that our team gathered information on the subject of mental and physical wellness, was by consulting an expert in the field. The individual that we had the pleasure of speaking with holds the following degrees and certifications.
- Bachelor of Physical and Health Education (BPHE)
- Bachelor of Arts (BA)
- Professional Certified Coach (PCC) with the International Coaching Federation (ICF)
- Certificate in coaching with positive psychology
- Certificate in coaching with emotional intelligence

Our expert was asked to reflect on their years of education and experience, to answer a handful of questions. The first thing we learned from speaking with an expert is that an increased amount of screentime in a person's daily routine is generally known to worsen their mental wellbeing. Their opinion on how much screen time is appropriate for the average person is 1/3rd of their waking hours, which for most people is approximately 5 hours. Reflecting on our public survey results, the majority of people spend 10+ hours per day looking at some form of screen. Evidently, the implication of these results is that most people average more than double our expert's recommended time.

As a countermeasure to rising amounts of screentime, our experts suggested the following strategies. First, having non-screen activities on hand and schedule them intermittently throughout the day to break up screen time. These activies could include listening to music, exercising, reading etc. Next, our expert recommended using only one primary source of social media, in an effort to reduce the amount of time spent scrolling. Lastly, in light of the pandemic, our expert advised using screens for genuine human connection as much as possible. Meaning, trading scrolling through media feeds for video calling with friends as this is known to replenish one's emotional tank.
